                        Experienced Data Scientist and Machine Learning Engineer with a deep AI research background and a strong track record of developing and managing scalable, AI-driven solutions. Currently advancing Liquid Neural Networks and Generative AI research at the Applied Artificial Intelligence lab, University of South Dakota, with a focus on NLP, Transformers, and vector-based AI applications. With expertise in cloud platforms like AWS and Azure, I bring hands-on experience in integrating AI/ML pipelines and automating DevOps processes across cloud-native infrastructures. <br />

                        Previously, as a Senior Manager at BYJUS, I led cross-functional teams to exceed performance benchmarks, managing complex projects from ideation through strategic solutions . Proficient in tools and technologies like LangChain, TensorFlow, PyTorch, Docker, Kubernetes, and infrastructure automation (Terraform, CloudFormation), I am adept at building CI/CD pipelines for AI/ML workloads and deploying containerized applications in environments like AWS ECS and EKS. <br />

                        A quick learner and T-shaped professional, I am passionate about leveraging AIOps and vector databases like Pinecone and FAISS for predictive analytics and operational automation. I thrive in collaborative settings, bringing a blend of technical depth and strategic management skills to every project. Let‚Äôs connect to discuss how I can contribute to driving AI-driven innovations and operational efficiencies within your team. <br />

                            <li>Worked on Liquid Neural Networks, gained knowledge on multiple research papers (CTRNN, Neural ODE, NPCs) to build models on
                                LNN, also on state-of-the-art architectures in LLM's, NLP, Transformers, Fraud Detection, Generative Al which is resulting in an 80%
                                accuracy in model performance at least.</li>

                                diverse tasks related to mathematical software development. Developed a model for detecting cancer in images of various organs across
                                different modalities, achieving superior results with limited resources. Authored a research paper based on this work and submitted it to
                                CVPR 2025, currently awaiting the review outcome.</li>
                            <li>Enhanced understanding of machine learning and AI concepts among 10+ undergraduate students by guiding them in resolving their
                                doubts and queries, while efficiently managing lab operations using R for practical demonstrations.</li>
