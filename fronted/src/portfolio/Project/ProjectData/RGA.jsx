                <p>
                    The "RAG-Deepseek" project focuses on building a Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG) system, leveraging advanced AI techniques for PDF-based conversational AI. Using OLamma Deepseek-r1:7b, this system achieves 95% precision in document retrieval while optimizing query latency by 30%.
